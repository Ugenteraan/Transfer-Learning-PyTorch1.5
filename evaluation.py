'''
Model Evaluation script. The evaluation strategy here is to show the prediction class of an image as an input image path is provided. Therefore, there is no need to use the DataLoader class to load the data. However, if you wish you evaluate in batches, use the LoadDataset class from load_data.py and DataLoader class to load the images. Note that the Evaluation script does not depend on any training parameters from train_cfg.
